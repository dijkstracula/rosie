![Is A Nice Cyber Dog](https://github.com/dijkstracula/rosie/rosie.png)

## Setting up
1. Create a new [bot user](https://api.slack.com/bot-users).
2. Add the bot token to your `config.json` but _do not check that file in!_
3. Invite your virtual pal to the channel of your choice.

## Feature ideas
* "go lie down" - squeltches activity for some set period of time.
* wanders between multiple rooms depending on where the most activity is.
* "play" protocol for other instances running
